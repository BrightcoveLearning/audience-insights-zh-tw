      <p>This series of knowledge base articles will highlight the ways that our customers are leveraging their harmonized data from Brightcove Audience Insights to run more effective campaigns.</p>
      <p>Making sure that our customers can realize value from the harmonized data that we create for them in our Scorecard and data platform is a core tenet of our business at Brightcove Audience Insights. One way that customers achieve this every day is by utilizing our data-rich subscriber exports in conjunction with their CRM &amp; campaign management systems. Because we harmonize subscriber/billing data, content metadata, and consumption/engagement data, along with marketing attribution, we can attach really interesting information to every user record that we export. This added information can be used to create well-targeted, context-rich campaigns for engaging with existing customers, finding new ones and winning back those customers who have left.</p>

      <p>This post focuses on the <strong>hoursViewedFirst30Days, </strong> and <strong>Tenure </strong> export fields, and how they can be leveraged for more effective campaigns.</p>  
      <p>The purpose of the <strong>hoursViewedFirst30Days </strong> field is to show how much viewing each customer is doing in their first month of activity. This metric can be used as an early detection tool for healthy users, bingers who might jump from the service, and users who are not engaging enough, and may be at risk because they aren't getting value.</p>
      <p>Healthy users who are initially watching at least a few hours a week are great subjects for lookalike campaigns in Facebook, which is easy to do with our subscriber exports. Users who are hyper-engaged can be great, but they can also be trying to burn through the content they joined the service to watch with the intention of canceling when they do. Finding these high-use customers early, and introducing them to more content that they might enjoy (using content consumption fields also available in subscriber export) is a great way to prolong their subscription. The low use scenario is probably the most important one in that first month. These users are good candidates for nudges about the service overall, and targeted content campaigns.</p>
      <p>To make sure that you are focusing on the right users, itâ€™s important to look at <strong>tenure</strong> in addition to hours viewed. That way you can focus on customers who have been using the service for say, sixty days or less, since the <strong>hoursViewedFirst30Days</strong> metric is something that matters most if you act on it in a relatively short period of time.</p>
      <p>All of these fields are included in our subscriber exports which can be automatically synced with products like Hubspot, where you can leverage the data to create the kinds of campaigns suggested above, and myriad others.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for posts on additional fields and the campaigns you could run based on them.</p>
