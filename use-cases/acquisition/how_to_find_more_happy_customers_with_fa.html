        Facebook Ads provides a powerful feature that lets you advertise to customers who are similar to a list of customers that you provide. This is called
        <em>
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lookalike Audiences</a>
        </em>
        . To advertise from your customers with Lookalike Audiences, you must create a
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/341425252616329?helpref=faq_content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom audience</a>

        This article describes how to use the
        <a href="https://www.wicketlabs.com/wicket-blog/turning-insights-into-action-introducing-subscriber-export/">Subscriber Export</a>
        feature of the Insights Scorecard in conjunction with Facebook Ads to create a custom audience that can be used in
        <em>Lookalike Audience</em> 
        -based campaigns.

      <h3>1) Download a list of your paying customers with a high CHI score.</h3>
      <p>
        Navigate to the
        <em>Customer Count</em>
        insight (Fig. 1). Below the insight is a selection of customer segments. To run a lookalike campaign, you should start with
        <strong>Net</strong>.

          <p>This opens the export dialog which we will use to select your best customers.</p>
          <p>To select your best customers, you should further filter “Current Subscribers” (Fig. 2)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Status</strong>
              – choose
              <em>Active</em>
              . This selects all of your current, active subscribers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tenure</strong>
              – choose
              <em>6+ months</em>
              . This selects customers who have subscribed for six months or more. These customers have a high lifetime value.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Last Video View</strong>
              – choose
              <em>within 30 days</em>
              . You want to select customers who are still currently watching videos.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>CHI Score</strong>
              – choose
              <em>Happy (80-100)</em>
              . These customers are unlikely to churn and have the highest LTV of your customers.
            </li>
          </ul>

            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Export customer count modal window</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Click the
            <em>Export</em>
            button to start the export report. Report progress is shown in the reports sidebar (Fig. 3).
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <figure class="bcls-figure">

            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Active subscribers with high CHI score report</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p></p>
          <p>Download the report when it completes and unzip it. For example, this report is a file named <code translate="No">insights_demo_account_current_subscribers_jan_10-apr_9_2018.csv</code></p>

       
          <h3>2) Sort and filter to select customers that best match your campaign.</h3>
          <p>Using spreadsheet software, open the CSV file, and review the subscriptions contained within.</p>
          <p>You can further filter the customers to match these lookalikes to the targeting associated with your campaign. For example, if you are going to run a campaign targeting Android users, you may want to filter your subscriber list to those users who have also used Android.</p>
          <p>The key requirement is that your file should have at least 1000 customers after the filtering.</p>
        
          <h3>3) Format the file</h3>
          <p>Facebook requires a specific format for the customer match file. For PII reasons, Brightcove Audience Insights only provides a hashed email address.</p>
          <p>
            Retitle the
            <em>emailHashSha2</em>
            column as
            <em>email</em>
            . This column follows Facebook’s best practice and formatting requirement for hashed email addresses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Retitle the
            <em>totalPayments</em>
            field as
            <em>value</em>
            . This column can be used for the LTV-based advertising in Facebook Ads.
          </p>
          <p>Remove other columns from the file and save it.</p>
        
        
          <h3>4) Use the file to create a Custom Audience</h3>

            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Assets &gt; Audiences</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            In the
            <strong>Facebook Ads Manager</strong>
            , you will navigate to the&nbsp;
            <em>Assets &gt; Audiences</em>
            (Fig. 4). This allows you to create a
            <strong>Custom Audience</strong>
            from your list of hashed emails.
          </p>
          <p>
            Choose to create a new
            <strong>Custom Audience</strong>
            from
            <strong>Customer File</strong>
            (Fig. 5).
          </p>
          <p></p>

            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Create a Custom Audience</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Then, select the type of the customer file as
            <strong>Customer file with lifetime value (LTV)</strong>
            (Fig. 6).
          </p>
          <p></p>

            <img src="/assets/images/use-cases/acquisition/fb/include-ltv.webp" alt="Facebook Ads, customer file with lifetime value (LTV)">
            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Customer file with lifetime value (LTV)</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            After selecting how we are going to create the
            <strong>Custom Audience</strong>
            (Fig. 7), we get to the page to upload our file. Make sure to select the correct
            <strong>Original Data Source</strong>
            . For Brightcove Audience Insights customers, you collect this data directly from your customers and that option should be selected.
          </p>
          <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img src="/assets/images/use-cases/acquisition/create-with-ltv.webp" alt="Create Custom Audience with LTV">

          </figure> 

          <p>
            Additionally, choose the
            <strong>upload file</strong>
            button and select the file we prepared in the steps above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Facebook will show you a preview of the data mapping. The hashed emails will initially be labeled with
            <em>Do Not Upload</em>
            . Select
            <strong>Email</strong>
            from the drop-down and it will be validated as SHA2 hashes and turn green for upload.
          </p>
          <p>
            Click to upload and create the
            <strong>Custom Audience</strong>
            (Fig. 8). Once it is uploaded, you should build a
            <em>Lookalike Audience</em>
            from that custom audience.

          <h3>5) Create a Lookalike Campaign using the Custom Audience list</h3>
          <p>
            Using Facebook Ads, create a campaign that uses this
            <strong>Custom Audience</strong>
            &nbsp;list (Fig. 9).
          </p>
          <p>Be sure to align the customer segmentation and filters you used to build this customer list to the campaign targeting and messaging.</p>
