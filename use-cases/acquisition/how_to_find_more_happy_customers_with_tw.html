      <p><a href="https://business.twitter.com/">Twitter Ads</a> provides a powerful feature that lets you advertise to customers who are similar to a list of customers that you provide. This is called <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/help/campaign-setup/campaign-targeting/tailored-audiences.html">Tailored Audiences</a>.</p>

      <!-- <p>This document describes how to use the <a href="https://www.wicketlabs.com/wicket-blog/turning-insights-into-action-introducing-subscriber-export/" data-wplink-url-error="true">Subscriber Export</a> feature of the Insights Scorecard in conjunction with Twitter Ads.</p> -->

      <h3>1) Download a list of your paying customers with a high CHI score.</h3>
      <p>Navigate to the <em>Customer Count</em> insight (Fig. 1). Below the insight is a selection of customer segments. To run a lookalike campaign, you should start with <strong>Net</strong>.</p>

        <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Customer Count insight</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This opens the export dialog which we will use to select your best customers.</p>
      <p>To select your best customers, you should further filter “Current Subscribers” (Fig. 2)</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Status</strong> – choose <em>Active</em>. This selects all of your current, active subscribers.</li>
        <li><strong>Tenure</strong> – choose <em>6+ months</em>. This selects customers who have subscribed for six months or more. These customers have a high lifetime value.</li>
        <li><strong>Last Video View</strong> – choose <em>within 30 days</em>. You want to select customers who are still currently watching videos.</li>
        <li><strong>CHI Score</strong> – choose <em>Happy (80-100)</em>. These customers are unlikely to churn and have the highest LTV of your customers.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/use-cases/acquisition/tw/export-customer-count.webp" alt="export customer count modal">
        <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Export customer count modal window</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Click the <em>Export</em> button to start the export report. Report progress is shown in the reports sidebar (Fig. 3).</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/use-cases/acquisition/tw/export-report.webp" alt="customer export report">
        <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">ctive subscribers with high CHI score report</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Download the report when it completes and unzip it. For example, this report is a file named <code translate="No">insights_demo_account_current_subscribers_jan_10-apr_9_2018.csv</code></p>
      <h3>2) Sort and filter to select customers that best match your campaign.</h3>
      <p>Using spreadsheet software, open the CSV file, and review the subscriptions contained within.</p>
      <p>You can further filter the customers to match these lookalikes to the targeting associated with your campaign. For example, if you are going to run a campaign targeting Android users, you may want to filter your subscriber list to those users who have also used Android.</p>
      <p>The key requirement is that your file should have at least 1000 customers after the filtering.</p>
      <h3>3) Format the file</h3>
      <p>Twitter requires a specific format for the customer match file. Up to 5 columns are allowed. For the security of your customer's personally identifiable information (PII), Brightcove Audience Insights only provides a hashed email address. Indeed, our processing of your customer's data operates solely on one-way hashed PII data.</p>
      <p>Retitle the <em>emailHashSha2</em> column as <em>Email</em>. This column follows Twitter's best practice and formatting requirement for hashed email addresses.</p>
      <p>Remove other columns from the file and save it.</p>
      <p>For additional details on the Twitter Match file formatting guidelines, refer to their <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/help/campaign-setup/campaign-targeting/tailored-audiences/TA-from-lists.html#how-do-i-prehash-my-file?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>.</p>
      <h3>4) Upload the file as a Tailored Audience to Twitter Ads</h3>
      <p>Sign in to Twitter Ads and upload your list (or update an existing list) using the file prepared above.</p>
      <p>In the Tools menu, select “Audience Manager” and then select to create a new audience by uploading your own list. Follow their guided steps and upload the file prepared above.</p>
      <h3>5) Create a campaign using the Tailored Audience list</h3>
      <p>Using Twitter Ads, create a campaign that uses this Tailored Audience list. Be sure to align the customer segmentation and filters you used during the export process to the campaign targeting and messaging.</p>
