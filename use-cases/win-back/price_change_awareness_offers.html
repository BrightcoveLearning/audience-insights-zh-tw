        major factors that contribute to subscriber churn
        , pricing is often
        <a href="http://www.parksassociates.com/blog/article/understanding-and-combatting-ott-churn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported as one of the top responses</a>
        by consumers. But we contend that it isn't so much of a pricing issue but comes down to the perceived value associated with the service. This can fall into two different categories within a video service:
      </p>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist"> 
        <li>
          Engagement Factors: Perceived value in the content library or
          <em>nothing to watch</em>
          syndrome
        </li>
        <li>Operational Factors: Technical problems and cost</li>
      </ol>
      <p>So, as you can see, price-consciousness is a big motivator for many individual's decisions on which services they'll continue to subscribe to or join.</p>
      <p>
        If your video service has experienced churn issues (who doesn't), it is highly likely that many of those former subscribers state
        <em>price</em>
        as the highest impact on their decision to leave. But we have good news. Using the tools in the Insights Scorecard, you can target people with lower prices or price change win-back campaigns!

          From the Customers tab of the Insights Scorecard, you can export a list of
          <i>Lost Subscribers</i>
          from the primary graph (Fig. 1).

        <li>
          Filter your export based on the criteria that are important to you and click Export. (Fig. 2) Since youâ€™re trying to lure back those that chose to leave your service but were happy subs, the following are suggestions:
          <ul>
            <li>Status = Lost (Voluntary)</li>
            <li>Tenure = 3+ months</li>
            <li>Last Video View = more than 90 days ago</li>
            <li>CHI Score = Happy (80-100)</li>
          </ul>
