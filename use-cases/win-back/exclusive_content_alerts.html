      <h2 id="Identify_the_Appropriate_Scenarios">Identify the Appropriate Scenarios</h2>
      <p>There are several scenarios that would lend themselves to employing this particular tactic and you could potentially extrapolate these to an even greater degree. For the most part, these are the cases you would run into and they are similar to the new/exclusive alerts tactics with the addition of the former subscriber's past viewing history factored in.</p>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
        <li>Releasing a new series</li>
        <li>Releasing a new season of a series</li>
        <li>Releasing a new movie</li>
        <li>Acquiring exclusive content</li>
      </ol>
      <p>So, how do we know they were happy before they churned? Every subscriber is given a
        <abbr class="abbr" title="Customer Happiness Index">CHI</abbr>
        score in the Insights Scorecard. Once they maintain a long-enough tenure in the video service. Every subscriber’s CHI score is captured and sustained when they leave.
      </p>
      <p>With Subscriber Export in the Insights Scorecard, you can distinguish fans of a series from those subscribers that just sampled a show. Targeting a specific show and exporting a list of lost customers with a high CHI score can yield a group that would benefit from seeing the new season, series, or movie. You can then refine this list down to just Fans to really refine the list to the people you desire to reach.</p>
      <p>Licensing exclusive content for your service would require a more timely message to inform them your service has exclusive rights to the new season of a series or a new movie. Reaching out to these former subscribers before the new season or series premiers is a great time to let them know they should come back because of the limited availability through your service. Who knows, maybe they'll even catch up on previous seasons to get back up to speed.</p>

          From the Customers tab of theInsights Scorecard, you can export a list of
          <i>Lost Subscribers</i>
          from the primary graph (Fig. 1).
          <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img src="/assets/images/use-cases/win-back/lost-customer-export.webp" alt="Insights Scorecard customers tab primary graph">
            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Insights Scorecard, Customer Count (primary graph). Export cohorts from here (see arrow)</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          Filter your export based on the criteria that are important to you and click Export. (Fig. 2) Since you’re trying to lure back those that chose to leave your service but were happy subs, the following are suggestions:
          <ul>
            <li>Status = Lost (Voluntary)</li>
            <li>Tenure = 3+ months</li>
            <li>Last Video View = more than 90 days ago</li>
            <li>CHI Score = Happy (80-100)</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img src="/assets/images/use-cases/win-back/subscriber-export-new-app.webp" alt="Export Customer Count modal">
            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Choose your exports options; Status, Tenure, Last Video View, and CHI Score</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once you have the
        <i>Lost Subscribers</i>
        list downloaded, you can integrate the data into your preferred email or marketing automation platform to begin your win-back campaign.
