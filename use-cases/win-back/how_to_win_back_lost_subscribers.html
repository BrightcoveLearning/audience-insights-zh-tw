      <p>In the highly-competitive <abbr class="abbr" title="Subscription Video on Demand">SVoD</abbr> landscape, acquiring customers can be an expensive proposition. It costs more money to find new customers than it does to keep the ones you have. Acquiring and engaging the right customers, keeping them long-term, and winning back former, happy customers is a great way to minimize acquisition costs.</p>
      <p>Chances are there are some former subscribers to your video service who were totally happy with their experience. There can be any number of reasons why they would churn but since they had a good overall experience before, perhaps they would come back to enjoy some new content.</p>

      <p>So, how do we know they were happy before they churned out? Every subscriber is given a
        <abbr class="abbr" title="Customer Happiness Index">CHI</abbr>
        score once they maintain a long-enough tenure in the video service. Every subscriberâ€™s CHI score is captured and sustained when they leave.
