      <p>This series of knowledge base articles will highlight the ways that our customers are leveraging their harmonized data from Brightcove Audience Insights to run more effective campaigns.</p>
      <p>Making sure that our customers can realize value from the harmonized data that we create for them in our Scorecard and data platform is a core tenet of our business at Brightcove Audience Insights. One way that customers achieve this every day is by utilizing our data-rich subscriber exports in conjunction with their CRM &amp; campaign management systems. Because we harmonize subscriber/billing data, content metadata, and consumption/engagement data, along with marketing attribution, we can attach really interesting information to every user record that we export. This added information can be used to create well-targeted, context-rich campaigns for engaging with existing customers, finding new ones and winning back those customers who have left.</p>

      <p>This post focuses on the <strong>top3GenresLast3Months, primaryGenreLifetime, </strong> and <strong>percentageWatchedInPrimaryGenreLifetime</strong> export fields, and how they can be leveraged for more effective campaigns.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the <strong>top3GenresLast3Months </strong> field is to show the genres of the content that a user watches the most, most recently. This can be used to target users appropriately when new content is published. By matching the genre of new, popular, and/or entertaining content with users who have recently been engaged with that genre, you're offering them a better value proposition from your service. To do this, you'd start with a content campaign in mind around a particular series or movie and then filter a subscriber export to focus on users who are a match for that genre.</p>

      <p>You can focus even more on specific genre fans by using <strong>primaryGenreLifetime </strong>in conjunction with <strong>percentageWatchedInPrimaryGenreLifetime. </strong>The first field obviously tells you the genre that the user has engaged with the most during their tenure as a customer. The second gives you a quantitative view of how much of their viewing is spent on content in their primary genre. You can use this a few ways. One, is to really dial in on finding good matches for customers who are narrowly focused on one genre.</p>
      <p>The other is to flip it around and try to introduce these users to content in adjacent genres, so that they are getting value from a broader section of your library. Both are easy to do by matching genres to exported subscribers. All of these fields are included in our subscriber exports which can be automatically synced with products like Hubspot, where you can leverage the data to create the kinds of campaigns suggested above, and myriad others.</p>
