      Churn rate isn’t the only metric that you should monitor for the health of your SVoD service but it’s definitely a primary metric that deserves a lot of attention. If there is a problem with your streaming service, the churn percentage will likely reflect this.

      Getting a handle on churn is not only for companies that are looking to fix their growth problems, understanding why it happens can also help to focus your efforts on the most productive areas. If net subscribers continue growing, you can still use this metric to see if you could be growing faster and addressing the cause of churn.
