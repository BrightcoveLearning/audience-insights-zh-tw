  <p class="intro">One of the main questions in running an SVOD business is how often are subscribers returning to watch content? Are they coming back daily, weekly, or monthly? What <em>is</em> the optimal frequency of return visits to keep customers subscribed for the long term? The easy answer is, it depends.</p>
  <blockquote class="et-pullquote left"><p>What <em>is</em> the optimal frequency of return visits to keep customers subscribed for the long term? The easy answer is, it depends.</p></blockquote>
  <p>In the continuing saga of the Streaming Wars, several companies are building massive content catalogs, spanning genres and categories to reach broad appeal as consumers look to cut the cord from traditional broadcast services. In an effort to become the daily destination for consumers, large services such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc., invest heavily in licensing and producing original content to increase their appeal and reinforce their value proposition.</p>
  <p>Their strategy appears to be working but there also appears to be room in the household budgets for a variety of streaming services. A recent study by Parks Associates shows that <a href="https://www.rapidtvnews.com/2020060858615/76-of-us-broadband-homes-had-ott-subs-in-q1-2020.html#axzz6OtP2dKSg">76% of US households have at least one video streaming service</a> and multiple subscriptions is now the norm with the <a href="https://nscreenmedia.com/nscreen-whitepapers/nScreen-nSights-OVS-consumer-attitudes-final.pdf">average subscriber having 3.4 services</a> and paying $8.53 per service through a variety of distribution channels, according to a separate survey by nScreenMedia. That said, not every service is, or should be, designed to be the daily destination to be a successful option for consumers.</p>
  <h2>Don’t Try to Be All Things to All People</h2>
  <p>Many OTT services are able to attract loyal subscribers that visit a limited number of times per week by providing fresh content with a very broad appeal. Either new movies for “family night” viewing or a couple of new episodes of a popular show to which they may have exclusive access. These services can compete by providing a deeper catalog of older shows and movies that are less expensive to license but have a broad appeal. Less top-level titles but a deeper bench of “role players.” The challenge in this type of service is keeping users engaged when the season ends or top tier content is running thin.</p>
  <p>In addition, there are services that have a great deal of success where users check in once or twice a month. Their content usually has a general appeal but is more focused on a particular topic or genre. With less emphasis on a broad content offering, users tend to be considered more of a <a href="https://www.wicketlabs.com/wicket-blog/from-subscription-membership/">member of a group</a>, rather than just a subscriber to a service, creating a more tailored experience.</p>
  <p>Regardless of the type of service being run, your goal is to keep your users coming back at the appropriate frequency to deliver on your value proposition. We have all heard the expression content is king, as it applies to managing subscription services. That is true, but as we have discussed, it is not the only reason for success in finding and retaining subscribers.</p>
  <p>No matter the type of service you are running, the <a href="https://www.wicketlabs.com/wicket-blog/5-main-reasons-subscribers-churn-and-what-to-do-about-it/">reasons for churn</a> are very similar. To better combat churn we should quickly look at the main reasons people cancel subscription services. The main reasons cited for leaving a service are typically price, experience, content availability to some degree. But let’s break those reasons down a little bit, as they are oftentimes interrelated.</p>
  <p>Price is less of a factor in deciding to leave a service. Sure individual realities change and users have to cut back when times are hard…<em>but</em> price is generally a reflection that the user does not perceive they are getting enough value for the cost of their subscription. This can really be about the experience of the service:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Do I have access to enough content?</li>
  <li>Can I find content easily?</li>
  <li>Are the apps easy to navigate?</li>
  <li>Can I access content from multiple devices?</li>
  <li>Many times the decision is about the price of the service (I knew that going in) but does the perceived value I am getting meet the price of the service?</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote class="et-pullquote right"><p>“I’m getting the content I want, as well as discovering new content while I watch the shows I like.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>If you’re relying on subscribers to come back at least a couple of times per week, make sure content discovery is as seamless as possible. You want subscribers to think, “I’m getting the content I want, as well as discovering new content while I watch the shows I like.” If subscribers are coming back too frequently, they will consume lots of content hours, so guiding them to the next movie and show becomes increasingly important to deliver on that value proposition. Two key data points in delivering on the frequency of engagement to look at are current and past viewing behavior. These help identify early on when a subscriber shows signs of waning and can allow you to make good recommendations to quickly bring them back.<br>
  The <a href="https://insights.wicketlabs.com/dashboard/summary">Audience Insights Dashboard</a> can be a great tool to identify these users and make the right suggestions to keep them engaged and coming back.</p>
  <h2>Identifying Where Users are in Their Viewing Habits</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.wicketlabs.com/wicket-blog/redefining-engagement-for-ott-video-services/">Engagement Status Over Time Wicket</a> (Fig. 1) is invaluable for making this determination. Each user is assigned an <b>Engagement Status</b> based on their most recent viewing pattern. Are they engaged? (coming back recently and frequently) Have they stopped coming back recently or weeks ago? Customize your messaging based on this status and look at recent consumption to target them at the right time with the right content options.</p>

  <p>When the current season of a popular show ends, we often see people start to drift away from a service because they don’t know what to watch next. Identifying this early (within the first couple weeks) is crucial to keeping that customer coming back on a weekly basis before they become idle and decide to cancel their subscription. Identify these subs quickly and leverage the Content Explorer to make the right suggestions in a timely manner to help discover that next show or movie.</p>

Combined with the <a href="https://www.wicketlabs.com/wicket-blog/understanding-content-through-lens-your-customer/">Attention Index</a>, it allows you to uplevel your suggestions from “people who watched this also watched this”….to “people that watched and liked this also watched and liked these shows.” Pre-set filters allow you to find the <b>Hidden Gems</b>, <b>Promotable Shows,</b> and <b>Dynamic Duos</b>&nbsp;(Fig. 3) in your catalog, introducing the right suggestion to subscribers at the right time.</p>
  <p>By leveraging these tools, you can suggest the content to subscribers they are looking for, on the devices they use, in a timely fashion that ensures a great customer experience and reinforces the value of your service.
