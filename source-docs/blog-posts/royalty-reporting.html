    <p>Not surprisingly, all of these enhancements drive a feedback loop that helps us understand the what, why, and how of our customers needs in the content insights arena.</p>
    <p>Our latest updates are a direct reflection of that feedback loop, and we’re excited to share that our customers can now export two content reports from their Scorecard account.</p>
    <h3>Royalty Reporting</h3>
    <p>The first is a response to our customers’ desire to have a simple way of generating royalty reports for their content partners. To do this effectively, we had to consider a few requirements.</p>
    <p>The first is that we had to make sure that we provided the proper measurement for calculating royalties. To cover the use cases we heard from our customers, we’re including <strong>view count</strong>, <strong>audience size</strong>, and <strong>hours viewed</strong> for every title, as well as seasonal and series rollups.</p>
    <p>Secondly, we had to make sure that we covered the reporting periods that our customers needed. Luckily, we already have support in our Scorecard to review our primary graphs with several date range options.</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-35787 aligncenter size-full" src="//m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Scorecard_Date_Ranges.png" alt="Audience Insights Dashboard Date Ranges" width="512" height="392" srcset="//m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Scorecard_Date_Ranges.png 512w, //m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Scorecard_Date_Ranges-480x368.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 512px, 100vw"></p>
    <p>The “Last Complete” date ranges are particularly important for royalty reporting, and as illustrated above, we cover the last two complete weeks, months, quarters and years.</p>
    <p>Finally, we need to provide a field for content owners so that reports go to the right licensor. We use our “franchise” field for this purpose, which is included in this export.</p>
    <p>Now, with this simple export, our customers can very easily access all the data they need to efficiently issue royalty reports.</p>
    <h3>Content Catalog Export</h3>
    <p>We have added a ton of new information to our Content Catalog which now includes the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Title/Season/Series names</li>
    <li>Type (e.g. movie, episode etc)</li>
    <li>First View Date</li>
    <li>Audience Size: 30/90/365 days + lifetime</li>
    <li>Video Views: 30/90/365 days + lifetime</li>
    <li>Attention Index: 30/90/365 days + lifetime</li>
    <li>Service/Net Service Rating</li>
    <li>View/Net View Share</li>
    <li>Unique Audience After Release (7,14,30 Days)</li>
    <li>Peak Audience</li>
    <li>Peak Audience Date</li>
    <li>Days to Peak Audience</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With all of this rich data now available, we naturally receive requests to provide more ways to explore and interact with it. There are limits to what makes sense to put into a curated product UI/UX so we decided that this was another great opportunity to leverage data export. Our customers can now download the data enumerated above as a CSV, sorted and filtered according to the view they create in the Wicket. This could be their entire library by title, all seasons of a particular series, just linear viewing etc. An example preview:</p>
    <p><img class="wp-image-35788 aligncenter size-full" src="//m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Content_Catalog_Export.png" alt="Audience Insights Dashboard Content Catalog Export" width="512" height="254" srcset="//m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Content_Catalog_Export.png 512w, //m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Content_Catalog_Export-480x238.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 512px, 100vw"></p>
    <p>This export allows our customers to see really big pictures, as well as incredibly detailed views of their content consumption. They can compare specific titles to see how they performed against one another. They can look at seasonal trends across multiple series to identify cross-promotional opportunities etc. Now, much of this can be done today right in the Scorecard, but providing a full library export just provides more entry points for exploration.</p>
