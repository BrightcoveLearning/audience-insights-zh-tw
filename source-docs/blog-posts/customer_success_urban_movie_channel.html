  <div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="intro"><span class="et-dropcap">UMC</span> is the first-to-market streaming channel catering to African-American and urban audiences offering a range of content to viewers. Founded by Robert L. Johnson, Chairman of RLJ Entertainment and founder of&nbsp; <abbr class="abbr" title="Black Entertainment Television">BET</abbr>, the female-focused service delivers original series, independent films, drama, romance, comedy, as well as fan-favorites such as <em>Boomerang</em> and <em>Love Jones</em>.</p></div>

  <div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="p1">“Our sister streaming service, Acorn TV, had been using the <a href="https://insights.wicketlabs.com/dashboard/summary">Audience Insights Dashboard</a>. We saw the capabilities of the dashboard and the great value Acorn TV was getting out of it,” said Sylvia George, the General Manager of <abbr class="abbr" title="Urban Movie Channel">UMC</abbr>, who has been with RLJ Entertainment for 20 years.</p>
  <h3 class="p1">Understand the subscriber</h3>
  <p class="p2">At the time they adopted the Audience Insights Dashboard, UMC felt there was more knowledge to be gained about the consumer experience with their content. “We didn’t have the depth of data that the Audience Insights Dashboard offers. We had developed a lot of capability internally on a dashboard for other types of data but this was much more sophisticated,” said George.</p>
  <p class="p2">George also noted, “There were layers of data in the Audience Insights Dashboard that take you further into the customer experience which we didn’t have access to with our current dashboard; for instance, understanding at a deeper level the behavior of people who were watching one title and what else they would watch following that. Being able to understand the customer experience beyond the surface has been incredibly helpful. Especially when it comes to things like the <a href="https://www.wicketlabs.com/wicket-blog/can-you-really-measure-happiness/">Customer Happiness Index</a> (CHI<sup>®</sup>). This was a really compelling feature for us and we’ve used to great effect in our marketing efforts.”</p></div>

  <h3>Continued Success</h3>
  <p>Adopting a new tool in a new business category can come with risks:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The tool does not perform as advertised</li>
  <li>Employees may not adopt</li>
  <li>Inadequate training</li>
  <li>The technology does not advance</li>

  <p>There is always a risk of taking on a new tool and it does not work as expected but George noted that “Since we had already seen the success of Acorn TV’s usage, we had very little concern here. We have weekly calls with the Customer Success team and they have been great about keeping us updated on new feature releases. They’re also instrumental in helping us to leverage CHI to create those lookalike audiences and critical in helping us implement the features in actual, real-life scenarios.</p>
  <p>“I’m most impressed with how Brightcove Audience Insights is constantly evolving the product and keeping us in the loop about that evolution. A lot of products evolve but they do a particularly good job at that. Now we have a tool that is even more useful and more beneficial than when we began using the Audience Insights Dashboard,” added George. “Having so much actionable data to drive acquisition and achieve the results we have has been impressive.”</p>
  <blockquote class="et-pullquote left"><p>“I’m most impressed with how Brightcove Audience Insights is constantly evolving the product and keeping us in the loop about that evolution.</p></blockquote>
  <p>The Audience Insights Dashboard comes packed with features that tackle the main problems most streaming video services are facing. By providing data-driven, actionable insights, Urban Movie Channel has integrated the Audience Insights Dashboard into their daily processes to leverage it for continued success.</p>
  <p>George concluded, “I feel like we haven’t even tapped into the full capabilities of the Audience Insights Dashboard, even with the success we’ve had. Every time the Customer Success team shows us a feature I think, ‘Oh my gosh, we need to use that!’ There are probably 10 things on my list like that. That’s the good part about having such a robust tool like an Audience Insights Platform!”</p>
