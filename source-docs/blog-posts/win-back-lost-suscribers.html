  <div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>At the same time though, competition has increased. There are more platforms out there than ever, with many others due to launch later this year. They’re all vying for their share of the consumer wallet, working hard to bring new users on board, and doing all they can to lure them away from other providers.</p>
  <p>As the streaming wars heat up, heightened competition will naturally cause the risk of churn to rise. Other factors will likely have an impact too, such as when shelter-at-home orders lift and people get back to normal.</p>
  <p>So, what should be done?</p>
  <p>Increased churn may be the reality that’s on the horizon for SVoD services, but it’s important to remember this doesn’t mean the end of the subscriber relationship. A lost subscriber doesn’t have to be lost forever, particularly when data insights are used to make re-engagement campaigns highly targeted.</p>
  <p>By taking action today to prepare for tomorrow, SVoD providers can mitigate rising competition by adopting best practices to reconnect lost subscribers. And, while they’re at it, take action to convert those subscribers into loyal fans to double down on long-term growth.</p>
