      <p>Similar to many industries, the effective use of data will be a decisive factor in determining the winners in
        the future of television. Results have already shown, companies who use a data-driven strategy to drive decisions
        in their organization are finding success. The 2019 edition of the NewVantage Partners Big Data and AI Executive Survey<sup><a href="#n1"> [1]</a></sup>
        found that a full 62% of businesses have already seen measurable results from their investment in big data and AI.</p>
      <p>The continued fragmentation of the traditional pay television audience has created new opportunities and challenges for media companies. Consumers
        are spending more time on social sites, OTT services, and personal devices. Traditional pay-TV “Cord-cutting” has accelerated and is expected to reach
        ~6.2% in 2019.<sup><a href="#n2"> [2]</a></sup> This has made reaching audiences more complex</p>

      <p>The bigger issue is, eventually, revenue should align with attention, which will mean a decline in income for traditional pay television; with the potential to replace it with digital experiences. Now, the Streaming Wars3 are ushering in this new era of digital experiences
        where established digital players are facing more competition from major media industry giants.</p>

      <p>With these dynamics as a backdrop, media companies are searching for new ways to reach their target audience. These efforts have created new silos of critical data that business leaders need to see, compare and synthesize to make informed decisions, and
        track results. To compete effectively in this evolving market, companies need a new level of sophistication in their business intelligence tools. As alternative platforms continue to grow, this has become increasingly urgent. As video businesses experience this
        multimedia shakeup, a need has emerged for a new class of platforms that provides the insights needed for more informed decision making</p>

      <h3>Unified view</h3>

        viewing location, primary viewing device, and more.</p>

      <h3>Milestones</h3>
      <p>Milestones track progress against your decisions and are persistent throughout each tab of the Insights Scorecard: Relaunching an app or website, a new season of a show, or even a special promotion to entice new users to sign up.

        Attention Index, which is similar to a net promoter score and allows you to quickly evaluate what content may require further scrutiny as well as surface
        hidden gems.</p>
