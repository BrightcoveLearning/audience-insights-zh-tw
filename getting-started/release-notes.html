    <h3>Configurable CSV Export</h3>
    <p><strong>Product Update:</strong> CSV downloads can be configured to select which columns are included. This reduces clutter and improves focus for customers working with downloaded data.</p>
    <h4>Details</h4>
    <p>Users can configure the CSV preview and download columns per Insight, across the entire Scorecard.  This configuration persists across browser refreshes and closures.</p>
    <p>Metadata tag labels appear as selectable columns in the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Popular Content &gt; Download Totals CSV</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Only accounts which have tags with a “key”:”value” schema, will be able to select the tag label as an active column. For example, assume you use tags with the format: “genre:period drama”, “genre:fantasy”.  In the CSV export, you would be able to select “genre” as a column (which was already the case, but you are now able to dynamically support additional columns).</p>
